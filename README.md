## Techevince Voting System

### Overview
This project aims to create a voting platform for Techevince, enabling users to cast votes for their preferred projects across different domains. The system focuses on the hardware domain for this initial implementation.

### Core Features

* **Main Web Page:** The primary interface for users to access the voting system.
* **Three Voting Sections:** Divides projects into distinct categories for targeted voting.
* **Hardware Section:** Dedicated section for hardware-related projects with detailed information.
* **Project Descriptions:** Provides in-depth details about each project to aid informed voting.
* **Institute Account Login:** Requires users to authenticate with their institute account for voting.
* **Voting Limit:** Each logged-in user can cast up to 3 votes within the hardware domain.

### System Flow
1. **Access Main Web Page:** Users navigate to the Techevince voting platform.
2. **Select Hardware Section:** Users choose the hardware section to view projects.
3. **Explore Projects:** Detailed information about each hardware project is accessible.
4. **Login with Institute Account:** Users are redirected to their institute's login page to authenticate.
5. **Cast Votes:** Logged-in users can vote for up to 3 hardware projects.

### Limitations
* Voting is currently restricted to the hardware domain.
* Users can only cast a maximum of 3 votes within the hardware section.

### Future Enhancements
* Expand voting to other domains (software, design, etc.).
* Implement a recommendation system based on user preferences.
* Allow users to provide feedback on projects.

### Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** [Specify frontend technologies, e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React]
* **Backend:** [Specify backend technologies, e.g., Node.js, Python, Django, Flask]
* **Database:** [Specify database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
* **Authentication:** [Specify authentication method, e.g., OAuth, SAML]
